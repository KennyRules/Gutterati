# Gutterati

C++ Data Structure Library, mainly for learning.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KennyRules/Gutterati.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KennyRules/Gutterati)

Currently using biicode (https://www.biicode.com/) for dependency and build management. 
To (currently) quickly get up and running, after installing biicode from the above link:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open a shell to the parent directory of Gutterati.
3. Run 'bii init Gutterati -L'
4. Run 'cd Gutterati'
5. Run 'bii build' to verify everything is setup.

To get Visual Studio 2015 setup, run 'bii configure -G "Visual Studio 14' in the Gutterati directory. You may need to update your CMake version. If you are using a different version, then substituting 14 with the correct version number should suffice.

Please see the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for more info.
