# FAQ {#faq}

## What is this?
Gutterati is a C++ data structure library, with a focus on simplicity, speed, and modern C++ features where applicable. 

## Is this production-ready?
Not at all! This project, currently, is more of a learning project with plans to pivot to be Production-ready as more features, testing and benchmarks get created.

## What does Gutterati mean?
It comes from the song "The Gutterati?" by The Fratellis from The Fratellis EP. 
Specifically, the lyric "Trying to get the whole thing straight in my head." was the inspiration for using "Gutterati" as I wanted to dive into creating a project using a bunch of techniques and technologies, like using behavior driven development, Travis CI, and more.

## Can I contribute?
Absolutely! I welcome any ideas for improvement, bugfixes, etc. Please keep in mind that currently a lot of the project is currently in flux, so implementing additional features/code overhauls, while awesome, would be better off on a fork.
