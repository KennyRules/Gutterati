# FAQ

## What is this?
This project is serving as central hub for various C++ ideas. For example, I am currently working on some basic data structure implementations.

## Is this production-ready?
Not at all! This project, by nature, is more of a sandbox to learn with. When I feel I have a solid idea and foundation to surround it with, I plan to create a standalone repo for it that would be more official.

## What does Gutterati mean?
It comes from the song "The Gutterati?" by The Fratellis from The Fratellis EP. 
Mainly the lyric "Trying to get the whole thing straight in my head." was the inspiration for using "Gutterati" as I wanted a repo I could try a bunch of techniques and technologies, like using behavior driven development, biicode, Travis CI, and more.

## Can I contribute?
Absolutely! I welcome any ideas for improvement, bugfixes, etc. Please keep in mind this is more for growing knowledge, so implementing additional features/code overhauls, while awesome, would be better off on a fork.
